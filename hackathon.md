### Hackathon

The RobustiPy hackathon is to be held from 12:30pm on the 27th of June at Said Business School. Directions on how to get there can be found [here](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/about-us/venue-hire/organiser-and-delegate-information/directions-park-end-street). The hackathon will in particular take place in Seminar Room A: There should be a member of our team waiting in the lobby helping to direct people to Seminar Room A from between 12:15-13:00.

A finalised schedule of events for the day is as follows:

- **12:30** - Tea and coffee on arrival with an optional drop-in session for installing RobustiPy.
- **13:00** - An introduction to the day.
- **13:05** - Introducing RobustiPy.
- **13:30** - RobustiPy in action (we provide some empirical and simulated examples).
- **14:15** - Pizzas!
- **14:45** - Bring Your Own Dataset or work as a team to test your data and (try to break!) RobustiPy!
- **15:45** - Take a break and make a slide or two to present back to the group.
- **16:15** - Present your findings, and prizes for best application!
- **17:00** - How can we improve RobustiPy?
- **17:45** - Roundtable discussion on the future of multiversal analysis.
- **18:15** - Social events (subject to interest) and further discussion!

We encourage participants to _try_ to install RobustiPy using the instructions found on the GitHub page [here](https://github.com/RobustiPy/robustipy). If you are unable to install RobustiPy for any reason, kindly email us in advance, or arrive in the ~30 minute pre-arrive session so that we can help with any installation issues (see above).

Participants will get the most use out of the session if they bring a dataset with them. We suggest a simple cross-sectional tabular file with _either_ a binary _or_ a continuous dependent variable, with one or more specific 'x' variables of interest. Generally, unless you want and have access to run this on a High Performance Computer, the dataset which you bring should have <10 control variables.

We would also kindly request registrants to consider reading the three papers listed on the 'Inspiration' section as described [here](https://robustipy.github.io/):

1. Simonsohn, U., Simmons, J. P., & Nelson, L. D. (2020). Specification curve analysis. Nature Human Behaviour, 4(11), 1208-1214.
2. Young, C., & Holsteen, K. (2017). Model uncertainty and robustness: A computational framework for multimodel analysis. Sociological Methods & Research, 46(1), 3-40.
3. Gelman, A., & Loken, E. (2013). The garden of forking paths: Why multiple comparisons can be a problem, even when there is no “fishing expedition” or “p-hacking” and the research hypothesis was posited ahead of time. Department of Statistics, Columbia University, 348(1-17), 3.

These three papers -- along with the results of our discussions on how to improve RobustiPy -- will form the basis of our final session on the future of multiversal analysis.

Finally, you should be able to find some slides relating to the day [here](https://robustipy.github.io/slides/robustipy_hackathon.pdf). This single slide deck contains administrative information, acts as the 'handout' for all sessions, and contains all other general information that you should reasonably need _on the day_ (including links to resources, slides, etc).

We look forward to seeing you there!!
