### Welcome to the **RobustiPy** homepage!

RobustiPy is an efficient multiversal library with bootstrapping, model selection, averaging, resampling, in-and-out-of-sample analysis (/explainable AI), and joint inference tests. It analyses various output spaces, in addition to the control variable space (e.g. multiple dependent variables, estimands of interest, etc). Developed for Python, it is designed to be both accessible and computationally efficient.

**Installation**: Installation is as simple (in Python) as:

```bash
pip install robustipy
```

for stable development releases. If you wanted to try our early-in-progress work, simply:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobustiPy/robustipy.git
cd robustipy
pip install .
```

**Examples:** A series of simulated examples which might be useful to get you up and running can be found [here](https://github.com/RobustiPy/robustipy/tree/main/simulated_examples). A series of empirical examples which might be useful can be found [here](https://github.com/RobustiPy/robustipy/tree/main/empirical_examples).

**Hackathon:** We held a hackathon regarding RobustiPy in Oxford during June 2024. Thanks so very much for everyone who came along, and those who helped out in general!

**Inspiration:** We found great inspiration in the following three papers, which you might also enjoy reading:
