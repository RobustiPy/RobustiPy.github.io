### Welcome to the **RobustiPy** homepage!

RobustiPy is an efficient multiversal library with model selection, averaging, resampling and out-of-sample analysis. Developed for Python and R, it is designed to be both accessible and computationally efficient.

#### Installation
Installation is as simple (in Python) as:

```bash
pip install robustipy
```

and (in R) as:

```R
install.packages("robustipy")
```

**Examples:** A series of toy examples with which might be useful to get you up and running can be found [here](https://github.com/RobustiPy/Toy-Examples). A series of empirical examples which might be useful can be found [here](https://github.com/RobustiPy/Empirical-Examples).

**Hackathon:** We are holding a hackathon regarding RobustiPy in Oxford during June 2024. Participants can click [here](./hackathon.html) for further information on the day's activities!

**Inspiration:** We found great inspiration in the following three papers, which you might also enjoy reading:
